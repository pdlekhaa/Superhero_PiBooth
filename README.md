This project at a high-level has students take a photo of themselves using a Rasberry Pi 5, and emails them their photo after it has been cartoonized. 

DratsX3.py is a program using curses to inform students of PCAS and lets them take their photo. 
DratsX4.py has some minor improvements. 
zoltar.py has functionality to email students their photo as soon as it's taken. 
zoltar2.py uses a different method to posterize the image. 

ShPiBver1.py is the final version which also allows students to retake the image if they would like, and updates the emailed message that sends along with their photo.
